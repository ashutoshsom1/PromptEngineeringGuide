# Types of Prompts

Prompt engineering leverages various prompt types to achieve different goals. Here are the most common types:

## Zero-shot Prompting
- No examples are provided.
- The model is expected to perform the task based solely on the instruction.

## Few-shot Prompting
- A few examples are included in the prompt to guide the model.
- Improves performance on complex or ambiguous tasks.

## Chain-of-Thought Prompting
- Encourages the model to reason step-by-step.
- Useful for tasks requiring logical reasoning or multi-step solutions.

## Other Types
- Self-consistency
- Knowledge generation
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
