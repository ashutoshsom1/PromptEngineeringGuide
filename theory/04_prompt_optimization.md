# Prompt Optimization Techniques

Prompt optimization is the process of refining prompts to maximize the quality, reliability, and safety of LLM outputs. As LLMs and prompting research advance, optimization has become a critical skill for practitioners.

## Latest Optimization Strategies (2025)

- **Clarity and Specificity:** Use clear, unambiguous instructions. Specify the desired format, length, or style.
- **Contextualization:** Provide relevant background, examples, or constraints to guide the model.
- **Delimiters and Structure:** Use delimiters (e.g., triple backticks, XML tags) to separate sections and reduce ambiguity.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Test, review, and adjust prompts based on model outputs and evaluation metrics.
- **A/B Testing:** Compare multiple prompt variants to identify the most effective one.
- **Prompt Chaining:** Break complex tasks into smaller, sequential prompts for better control and reasoning.
- **Self-Consistency:** Generate multiple outputs and select the most consistent or accurate response.
- **Role Assignment:** Assign roles to the model (e.g., "You are an expert data scientist...") to influence behavior.
- **Adversarial Testing:** Test prompts against edge cases and adversarial inputs to ensure robustness.

## Example
