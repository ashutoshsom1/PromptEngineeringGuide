Optimizing prompts can significantly improve LLM performance. Techniques include:

- Rewriting for clarity
- Adding context or constraints
- Using delimiters or formatting
- Iterative refinement (A/B testing)

## Example
- Before: "Summarize this."
- After: "Summarize the following article in three bullet points: [article text]"
