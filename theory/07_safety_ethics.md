# Safety and Ethics in Prompting

As LLMs become more powerful, prompt engineering must prioritize safety, ethics, and responsible AI use. The latest best practices (2025) include:

- **Bias Mitigation:** Avoid prompts that reinforce stereotypes or produce biased outputs. Test with diverse inputs and use bias detection tools.
- **Misinformation Prevention:** Design prompts to minimize hallucinations and factually incorrect outputs. Use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for grounded answers.
- **Privacy Protection:** Never prompt models to generate, infer, or reveal sensitive or personal data. Mask or redact sensitive information in context.
- **Abuse Prevention:** Prevent prompts that could generate harmful, toxic, or unsafe content. Use content filters, moderation, and adversarial testing.
- **Transparency:** Clearly communicate model limitations, sources, and confidence levels in outputs.
- **Adversarial Testing:** Regularly test prompts for vulnerabilities (e.g., prompt injection, jailbreaking, leaking instructions).
- **Ethical Guidelines:** Follow the latest research and guidelines from organizations like OpenAI, Anthropic, DAIR.AI, and academic communities.

## Best Practices

- Review outputs for bias, safety, and factuality
- Use automated and manual content filters
- Stay informed about evolving ethical standards and regulations
- Document prompt design decisions and evaluation results
