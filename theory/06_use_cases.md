# Use Cases by Domain

Prompt engineering powers a wide range of real-world applications across domains. The latest use cases (2025) include:

- **Summarization:** Condensing long texts, articles, or documents into concise summaries. (e.g., news, research, legal)
- **Classification:** Assigning categories, labels, or tags to text, images, or data. (e.g., sentiment, topic, intent)
- **Data Extraction:** Pulling structured data from unstructured text, tables, or web pages. (e.g., entity extraction, information retrieval)
- **Translation:** Converting text between languages, dialects, or formats. (e.g., multilingual chatbots, localization)
- **Creative Writing:** Generating stories, poems, scripts, or marketing copy. (e.g., content creation, brainstorming)
- **Code Generation:** Writing code snippets, SQL queries, or scripts from natural language instructions. (e.g., coding assistants, data analysis)
- **Question Answering:** Answering open-domain or domain-specific questions. (e.g., customer support, knowledge bases)
- **Reasoning & Math:** Solving logic puzzles, math problems, or multi-step reasoning tasks. (e.g., chain-of-thought, tree of thoughts)
- **Function Calling & Tool Use:** Integrating LLMs with external tools, APIs, or databases. (e.g., ReAct, function calling)
- **Adversarial & Safety Testing:** Detecting vulnerabilities, biases, or unsafe outputs. (e.g., prompt injection, jailbreaking)
- **Agentic Workflows:** Building autonomous agents that plan, reason, and act using LLMs. (e.g., ReAct, Reflexion, AutoGen)
