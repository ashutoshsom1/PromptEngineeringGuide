# Introduction to Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the art and science of designing effective prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Gemini, and others. This section covers the basics, history, and importance of prompt engineering.

## What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering involves crafting input instructions (prompts) to elicit desired outputs from LLMs. Well-designed prompts can:
- Improve accuracy
- Reduce ambiguity
- Control output style and format

## Why is Prompt Engineering Important?
- Maximizes the utility of LLMs
- Enables task-specific customization
- Reduces the need for model retraining

## Key Concepts
- **Prompt**: The input text or instruction given to an LLM.
- **Completion**: The output generated by the LLM in response to a prompt.
- **Context**: Additional information provided to the model to improve relevance.
