# Prompt Evaluation and Testing

Evaluating prompt effectiveness is essential for building reliable and trustworthy LLM applications. The latest best practices combine human review, automated metrics, and adversarial testing.

## Evaluation Metrics (2025)

- **Accuracy:** Does the output match the expected answer?
- **Relevance:** Is the response on-topic and contextually appropriate?
- **Consistency:** Are repeated outputs stable and logical?
- **Diversity:** Does the model avoid repetitive or generic answers?
- **Faithfulness:** Is the output grounded in the provided context or source?
- **Safety:** Are outputs free from harmful, biased, or unsafe content?

## Evaluation Methods

- **Manual Review:** Human assessment of output quality and safety.
- **Automated Metrics:** Use BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, or custom metrics for quantitative evaluation.
- **A/B Testing:** Compare different prompts or models side-by-side.
- **Adversarial Testing:** Challenge prompts with edge cases and adversarial examples.
- **Prompt Hub & Benchmarks:** Use community benchmarks and prompt libraries for standardized testing.
