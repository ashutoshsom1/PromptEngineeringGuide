This file contains exercises and real-world scenarios for practicing Natural Language Understanding (NLU).

## 1. Text Classification

- Add a new entity type (e.g., product) to your NER pipeline.

## 3. Semantic Parsing

## 4. Sentiment Analysis
- Analyze the sentiment of customer reviews and visualize the results.

## 5. Advanced
- Evaluate your NLU model using accuracy, F1, precision, and recall.
- Test your NLU pipeline with ambiguous or noisy text inputs.
