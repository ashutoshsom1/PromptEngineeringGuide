# Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Guide

Welcome to the NLU section! This guide covers the theory, practical examples, hands-on notebooks, and exercises for mastering Natural Language Understanding.

## Structure
- `/theory` — Concepts, models, and best practices for NLU
- `/examples` — Python code samples for text classification, entity recognition, semantic parsing, etc.
- `/notebooks` — Jupyter notebooks for hands-on NLU experimentation
- `/exercises` — Practice problems and real-world NLU scenarios

Start with the theory, then explore examples and notebooks, and reinforce your learning with exercises.
