# Introduction to Natural Language Understanding (NLU)

Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a core area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. NLU powers applications such as chatbots, search engines, and intelligent assistants by extracting structured meaning from unstructured text.

## Key Concepts
- **Text Classification:** Assigning categories or labels to text (e.g., spam detection, topic classification)
- **Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying and classifying entities (e.g., people, locations, organizations)
- **Semantic Parsing:** Mapping natural language to structured representations (e.g., SQL queries, logical forms)
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in text

## Popular NLU Models
- BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT (fine-tuned for NLU tasks)
- spaCy
- Stanford CoreNLP
- Hugging Face Transformers

## Applications
- Search and information retrieval
- Customer feedback analysis
- Virtual assistants and chatbots
