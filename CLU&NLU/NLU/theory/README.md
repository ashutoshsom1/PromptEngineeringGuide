This section covers the foundational concepts, models, and best practices for NLU, including:

- What is NLU?
- Key tasks: text classification, entity recognition, semantic parsing, sentiment analysis
- Popular models: BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, F1, precision, recall, etc.
- Best practices for building robust NLU systems
