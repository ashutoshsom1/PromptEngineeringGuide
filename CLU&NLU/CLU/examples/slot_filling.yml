# CLU Example: Slot Filling with Rasa NLU

This script demonstrates how to define a simple Rasa NLU configuration for slot filling in conversational text. Rasa NLU is a popular open-source framework for conversational AI.

```yaml
# nlu.yml (Rasa NLU training data)
version: "3.0"
nlu:
- intent: book_flight
  examples: |
    - I want to book a flight from [New York](origin) to [Paris](destination) on [June 10th](date)
    - Book a ticket to [London](destination) from [Berlin](origin) for [tomorrow](date)
```

You can train and test this with the Rasa CLI:

```powershell
rasa train nlu
rasa shell nlu
```

This approach can be extended for more complex slot filling and dialogue management tasks.
