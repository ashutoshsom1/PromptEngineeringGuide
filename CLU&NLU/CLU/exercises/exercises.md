# CLU Exercise Set

This file contains exercises and real-world scenarios for practicing Conversational Language Understanding (CLU).

## 1. Intent Detection
- Write a zero-shot prompt to classify the intent of: "Can you play some jazz music?"
- Fine-tune a transformer model for custom intent detection (e.g., book_hotel, cancel_reservation).

## 2. Entity Extraction
- Extract entities from: "Order a pizza to 123 Main St for 7pm tonight."
- Add a new entity type (e.g., food_item) to your entity extraction pipeline.

## 3. Slot Filling
- Create a slot filling schema for a restaurant booking assistant.
- Simulate a multi-turn conversation and fill all required slots.

## 4. Dialogue State Tracking
- Track the state of a conversation for a flight booking scenario (origin, destination, date, passenger count).

## 5. Advanced
- Evaluate the performance of your CLU model using accuracy and F1 score.
- Test your CLU pipeline with adversarial or ambiguous user inputs.
