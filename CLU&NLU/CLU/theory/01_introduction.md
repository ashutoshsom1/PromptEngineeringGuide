# Introduction to Conversational Language Understanding (CLU)

Conversational Language Understanding (CLU) is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) focused on extracting structured meaning from conversational text. CLU powers chatbots, virtual assistants, and voice interfaces by enabling them to understand user intents, extract entities, and manage dialogue context.

## Key Concepts
- **Intent Detection:** Classifying the user's goal (e.g., book_flight, check_weather)
- **Entity Extraction:** Identifying key information (e.g., date, location, product)
- **Slot Filling:** Mapping entities to required fields for task completion
- **Dialogue State Tracking:** Maintaining context across turns in a conversation

## Popular CLU Models
- Microsoft CLU (Azure Language Service)
- BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT (fine-tuned for intent/entity tasks)
- Rasa NLU
- Hugging Face Transformers

## Applications
- Customer support bots
- Virtual assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant, Cortana)
- Voice-driven apps
