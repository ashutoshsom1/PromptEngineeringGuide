# Notebooks: Hands-on Prompt Engineering

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for hands-on experimentation with prompt engineering. Notebooks include:

- Interactive demos of zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting
- Prompt optimization and evaluation workflows
- Visualization of prompt outputs and model behavior
- Exercises and challenges for self-assessment

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` using:

   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Run and modify cells to experiment with different prompts and techniques.
