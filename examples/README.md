# Examples: Prompt Engineering in Python

This directory contains runnable Python code examples demonstrating both foundational and advanced prompt engineering techniques. Each file is linked to a corresponding theory section and covers:

- Zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting
- Prompt optimization and evaluation
- Advanced techniques (ReAct, RAG, prompt chaining, Reflexion, etc.)
- Model-specific and domain-specific prompts

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies from `/notebooks/requirements.txt`.
2. Review and run the scripts to see prompt engineering in action.
3. Modify the prompts and observe how outputs change.

### Example Scripts

- `zero_shot.py`: Zero-shot prompting for translation and summarization
- `few_shot.py`: Few-shot prompting for sentiment analysis and classification
- `chain_of_thought.py`: Chain-of-thought prompting for reasoning and math
- `prompt_optimization.py`: Before/after prompt optimization and A/B testing
- `react_agent.py`: ReAct (Reason + Act) agent example (NEW)
- `rag_example.py`: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) example (NEW)
- `reflexion_example.py`: Reflexion technique for iterative improvement (NEW)
