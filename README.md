# Prompt Engineering Guide

Welcome to the Prompt Engineering Guide! This repository is designed for both self-learners and trainers who want to master prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs).

## Repository Structure

- `/theory` — In-depth theoretical explanations, latest techniques, and best practices
- `/examples` — Python code samples demonstrating prompt engineering techniques, including advanced and model-specific prompts
- `/notebooks` — Jupyter notebooks for hands-on experimentation, prompt evaluation, and visualization
- `/exercises` — Practice problems, challenges, and real-world scenarios for each section

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Start with `/theory`**: Read through the theoretical modules to build foundational knowledge, including the latest developments as of 2025.
2. **Explore `/examples`**: Review and run Python code samples to see both basic and advanced concepts in action.
3. **Experiment in `/notebooks`**: Use the provided Jupyter notebooks to try out prompt engineering techniques, compare outputs, and visualize results.
4. **Test Yourself in `/exercises`**: Reinforce your learning with hands-on challenges and real-world tasks.

## Main Topics Covered

- Introduction to Prompt Engineering (2025 update)
- Types of Prompts (Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain-of-thought, Meta, ReAct, Reflexion, RAG, etc.)
- Prompt Templates and Advanced Patterns
- Prompt Optimization Techniques (clarity, chaining, self-consistency, etc.)
- Prompt Evaluation and Testing (metrics, adversarial, A/B, safety)
- Use Cases by Domain (summarization, classification, data extraction, code, agents, etc.)
- Safety and Ethics in Prompting (bias, privacy, adversarial, transparency)
- Tools & Libraries (LangChain, Guidance, PromptLayer, OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)
- Model-Specific Guides (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Llama, etc.)
