# Prompt Engineering Guide

Welcome to the Prompt Engineering Guide! This repository is designed for both self-learners and trainers who want to master prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs).

## Repository Structure

- `/theory` — In-depth theoretical explanations and best practices
- `/examples` — Python code samples demonstrating prompt engineering techniques
- `/notebooks` — Jupyter notebooks for hands-on experimentation
- `/exercises` — Practice problems and challenges for each section

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Start with `/theory`**: Read through the theoretical modules to build foundational knowledge.
2. **Explore `/examples`**: Review and run Python code samples to see concepts in action.
3. **Experiment in `/notebooks`**: Use the provided Jupyter notebooks to try out prompt engineering techniques interactively.
4. **Test Yourself in `/exercises`**: Reinforce your learning with hands-on challenges.

## Main Topics Covered

- Introduction to Prompt Engineering
- Types of Prompts (Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain-of-thought, etc.)
- Prompt Templates
- Prompt Optimization Techniques
- Prompt Evaluation and Testing
- Use Cases by Domain (summarization, classification, data extraction, etc.)
- Safety and Ethics in Prompting
- Tools & Libraries (LangChain, Guidance, PromptLayer, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python dependencies (see `/notebooks/requirements.txt`).
3. Open the notebooks and start experimenting!
